# Dungeon Mayhem Online

![](dm.png)

## A Refresher

- A fast-paced and easy-to-learn card game based on Dungeons and Dragons
- 12 classes with unique cards and abilities to choose from

## Our goals for the project

- The Base Game 
- 3D tabletop with tokens and simple 3d effects 
- Local Multiplayer
- AI
- Custom Cards

# Our Progress 

## Game Logic

We have written and tested the game logic

We used the nodejs console to run randomized games and check the rules and implemented correctly

The game logic is also already integrated with the 3D Tabletop interface

## The 3D Tabletop

The implementation is ongoing, but most of the foundation is done

I used a online free collection of 3D printable miniatures for Dungeons and Dragons to create the tokens for each character

### Still Left:

Particle Effects and Animations

Proper design of the cards

## AI

Started progress, and refactored the internal game logic to support cloning the game state for simulating

## Local Multiplayer

Looked up networking libraries

The bulk of the work is left to do, but will be completed after Graphics is in a better place

## Custom Cards

Not started
