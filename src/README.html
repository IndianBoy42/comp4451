                <h1>Dungeon Mayhem Online</h1>
                <p>
                    Use the Add Local Player section to add a controllable
                    player on this computer, click the Class you want and a new
                    set of cards should be added to the table. Use the Add AI
                    Player section similarly to add a computer controlled
                    player, warning: Its quite good.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can play locally, or connect to other people on the same
                    network. For testing you can use multiple tabs on the same
                    computer/browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On one computer/tab click "Add Remote", a new section is
                    added, you can follow the instruction in the Status field.
                    You need to send a token back and forth to establish the
                    connection, the Copy and Paste will automatically use your
                    clipboard so you dont have to select or type manually.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Host: Copy the token by clicking Copy, send that string
                        to the other person.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Player: Copy the token you received from the host, and
                        click the Paste button.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A new token will be added to your clipboard
                            automatically, send it to the host
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        Host: Copy the token you received from the player, and
                        click the Paste button
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A new set of cards should be added, and the remote
                        player should see the game state.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The game should be fairly simple to follow, selectable items
                    have a red spotlight on them, the current player has a cyan
                    spotlight
                </p>
